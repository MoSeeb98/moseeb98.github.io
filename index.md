## Welcome!
I am a PhD student at the [ifo Center for the Economics of Education](https://www.ifo.de/en/research/ifo-center-for-the-economics-of-education) and [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) Munich, currently doing a research stay at the [Yale Department of Economics](https://economics.yale.edu/about-economics). I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of education and labor economics. My current research primarily uses LinkedIn data to study how skills, social connections, and technological change shape career trajectories and labor market inequality.

- Career Effects of Online Social Network Access at Labor Market Entry  
  <details>
    <summary><a href="#">Abstract</a></summary>
    <p>
    Does access to online social networking platforms affect young workers’ careers? Exploiting the staggered introduction of Facebook across U.S. colleges in a generalized difference-in-differences design, this paper estimates the causal impact of Facebook access at labor market entry on the career trajectories of U.S. college students. Using detailed CV data from over 750,000 public LinkedIn profiles, I find that U.S. business students with Facebook access at graduation are more likely to receive early-career promotions and reach senior leadership roles in their mid-30s to early 40s. I identify two key mechanisms explaining the long-run career effects: Facebook access at graduation (i) facilitates a successful college-to-work transition; (ii) increases networking among college peers to climb the career ladder. The findings highlight how online social network usage for work-related purposes can reduce information frictions and foster long-run career success.
